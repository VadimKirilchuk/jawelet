This project is dedicated to my graduate work about compression of images.
The algorithm is based on discrete wavelet transfom(DWT).

Here you can find some code related to Discrete Wavelet Transform, Cyclic Extension, Haar wavelet filters, LeGall 5/3 filters.

@See also https://github.com/cscheiblich/JWave for more Wavelets and other transforms implementations
